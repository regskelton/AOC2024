# Advent of Code 2024

My scrapbook for code for Advent of Code 2024

## Description

My first time on AOC, and a long time since I did any coding. I think of it as peeling back the
layers of management-isation I've been through - that almost explains why I did the first few days
with Excel. And when I felt I had to get some "proper" programming, I went back to java which I used
extensively, back in prehistoric times. That got me through about the next 10 days, but I kept stumbling
with the verbiage; I'd "forgotten" I did a little javascript about 5 years ago, which is much more terse 
(and much easier to really mess things up), so in the end I switched to javascript...but javascript running
in a browser, which was interesting for some of the graphical challenges - access to a canvas object was
fun, watching the little robots guards run around.

## Health warning

None of this is polished. As soon as I got answer that worked, I pretty much stopped. I have a plan to go back 
through and fix it all up, but you know about plans. And often, doing part 2 broke part 1.

A lot of it (esp the javascript) contains archaeological artefacts from a "gravity" simulator I did a while back
(probs on here somewhere) most of it unused, I just used it to remind me of the basic structure.

And none of it should be taken for a good way of doing anything.
